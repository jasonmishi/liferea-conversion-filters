# Liferea Conversion Filters

A collection of conversion filters for the Liferea feed aggregator that can be
used to convert feeds to a more usable format.
Motivations for conversions can range from the input feed is not in a valid
format to removing parts of the feed you don't want to see.

I started this repository because the one in the documentation
([https://kiza.eu/software/snownews/](web.archive.org/web/20140627195945/https://kiza.eu/software/snownews/))
is no longer up.

## Installation

Please refer to the liferea documentation for how to use conversion filters: <https://lzone.de/liferea/help1140/subscriptions_en.html>.
